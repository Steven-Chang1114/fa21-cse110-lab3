# What did I work on yesterday?
I finished setting up the lab and create labels for the issues

# What am I working on today?
I finished the second part of the lab including the css files with
all the required styles as well as different types of the selectors

# What issues are blocking me?
All differents type of selectors are very new to me,
so I spent a lot of time doing research online to learn
the purpose of each of the selectors.
